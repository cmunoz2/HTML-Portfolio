    <p>When I visited the town where my mother grew up, I recieved a bit of culture shock. I didn't expect everyone to know each other and for everything to be so slow and calm. I quickly fell in love with it and the city we ended up visiting as well. The visit only solidified the pride in my heart I have for <i>mi jente</i>, my people.</p>
