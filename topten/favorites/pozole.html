    <h1>Pozole Recipe</h1>
    <p>Here is where we will learn to make Pozole in a few quick and (most importantly) <em>easy</em> steps.</p>
<h2>What you will need</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Rotisserie Chicken</li>
    <li>Chiles Guajillos</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Hominy</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li></ul>
<h2>How to make it</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Break off the ends of the chiles(the "tail"), leaving only the body. </li>
    <li>Put the chiles to boil in a pot, leave them until they are soft.</li>
    <li>While you let that boi, go ahead and pull the chicken apart with your hands. Make sure to leave out bones and the skin.</li>
    <li>While continuing to wait for the chiles, open up the hominy and clean the hominy using water. This is best done if you leave it all in the can and fill it with water and then shaking it to get it all.</li>
    <li>By now your chiles should be done boiling, turn off the oven top and grab tongs to test and grab your chiles.</li>
    <li>Put all your chiles into a blender, along with about 3/4 water, a palm of salt and pepper, along with two garlic teeth, <em>NOT</em> cloves!!</li>
    <li>Set blender to chop. The consitency may be thick but that is okay! It wont be soon!</li>
    <li>Now, dump all your hominy into a large pot. This will house the rest of the dish.</li>
    <li>Next take a strainer and strain all the contents in the blender into the large pot with the hominy. (You may need to use a spoon in order to get it all strained well.</li>
    <li>continuing to use the strainer, you will fill the pot up with water (using the strainer to catch anything caught in its contents) until the hominy is well covered. Remember guys, this is a soup so the broth is very important</li>
    <li>Now disgard the contents in the strainer, making sure to be careful to not touch your eyes!</li>
    <li>After that, just add the pulled chicken into the broth and set the entire thing to boil.</li>
        <li>Feel free to add more salt if you think it needs more. More often than not, it will need more!</li>
    </ol><br>
    <h3>Why Pozole?</h3>
    <p>Pozole is probably one of my favorite dishes because even I can make it, and I am not a skilled chef. Secondly, I am extremely proud to be Hispanic and I feel like this dish reflects my culture a little bit.</p>
    <h3>Alternatives</h3>
    <p>A lot of people use turkey instead of chicken. While that is okay, it is a lot more work. This method would require a day to prepare.</p><br>
    <p>Other people will leave the bones in the Pozole in order to give it extra flavor. The reason I do not use these alternatives is because I do not like the grease the bones add, and I like to be able to do it all in about two hours...<br>
    Additionally its a lot less work.</p>
